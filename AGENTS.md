# Code style

## Comments

Keep comments short. Prefer one line, with two lines as an absolute maximum.
Explain _why_ something is done, not _what_ the code does — the what
should be inferable from the code. Don't restate a function's behavior in its
doc comment when the signature already says it (e.g. write "returns the access
level, respecting the cache" — not a paragraph re-deriving the caching).
Aggressively delete comments that narrate obvious implementation details.
